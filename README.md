A challenge of refactoring and writing semantic html.

# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

## My Task

This week my challenge is an on-the-job ticket, which means I'll begin with starter code that I need to modify. This week's challenge is about making a website accessible on all screen sizes. 

**Important**: An important rule to follow when working with someone else's code is the **Scout Rule**, which recommends that you always leave the code a little cleaner than when you found it.

### User Story

```
AS A Frontend developer
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT my site is optimized for search engines
```

### Acceptance Criteria

building a website that meets accessibility standards and includes the following criteria.

* Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code
* HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* Image and icon elements contain accessible `alt` attributes
* Heading attributes fall in sequential order
* Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title

### Resources:
To help me make the appropriate changes I read though the documentation for semantic HTML.

* [Semantic HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp)
* [Image `alt` attributes](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_img_alt.asp)

### Mock-Up

### Getting Started

I followed the a step by step order to create my project and deploy it to GitHub Pages as showed below:

1. I created a new repository on your GitHub account and clone it to your computer.

2. When I was ready to deploy, I used the `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` commands to save and push your code to your GitHub repository.

3. Next, I navigated to my GitHub repository in the browser and then selected the Settings tab on the right side of the page.

4. On the Settings page, I scrolled down to the GitHub Pages section. Then, in the section labeled Source, selected the `main` branch as my source.

5. Navigated to <my-github-username.github.io/my-repository-name> and I found that my new webpage has gone live! For example, if my GitHub username is "lernantino" and the project is "css-demo-site", then my URL would be <lernantino.github.io/css-demo-site>.
